# Cognitive Services, Serverless Compute in Azure & Azure Stack



This is a 45 minute session to demonstrate rapid innovation using Azure Functions, Cognitive Services and Node.js on both Azure and Azure Stack

In this session you can -

- Build out a Severless PaaS web application using Azure Functions

- Deploy some open source code Node.js code that uses Azure Cognitive Services AI to analyse text and return a sentiment score
