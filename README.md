# Cognitive Services, Serverless Compute in Azure & Azure Stack



This is a 45 minute session to demonstrate rapid innovation using Azure Functions, Cognitive Services and Node.js on both Azure and Azure Stack. The [Lab Guide](https://github.com/ben-houghton/summitcode/raw/master/SummitLab.pdf) will walk you through the steps required. 

In this session you can -

- Build out a Severless PaaS web application using Azure Functions

- Deploy some open source code Node.js code that uses Azure Cognitive Services AI to analyse text and return a sentiment score

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/ 

- You will then redeploy this exact code to Azure Stack, demonstrating how interoperable the two environments are

You will need Cognitive Service keys for the Computer Vision and Text Analytics APIs
